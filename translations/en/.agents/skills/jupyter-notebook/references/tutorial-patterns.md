# Tutorial Patterns

Use this structure for teaching and walkthroughs:

- Audience, prerequisites, and learning goals: say who it is for, list what they should already know, and state what they will be able to do by the end.
- Outline: provide a short numbered outline so readers can skim.
- Step-by-step flow: pair a short markdown explanation with a small code cell that runs on its own and a brief interpretation of the result.
- Exercises: include at least one exercise that reinforces the key concept and provide an answer scaffold in the next cell.
- Pitfalls and extensions: call out one common mistake and how to fix it, and suggest one optional extension for curious readers.
