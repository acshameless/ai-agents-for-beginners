# Experiment Patterns

Use dis structure for exploratory and experimental work:

- Title and objective: talk di question and di success criteria.
- Setup and reproducibility: import only wetin you need, set seed early, and keep configuration for one short cell.
- Plan: list hypotheses, sweeps, and metrics before you run code.
- Minimal baseline: start wit di smallest runnable example and confirm say e fit run from beginning to end before you add complexity.
- Results and notes: summarize findings for markdown near di relevant code and record key metrics inside small dictionary or table-like structure.
- Next steps: decide whether to continue, pivot, or stop, and capture follow-up ideas as short bullets.
